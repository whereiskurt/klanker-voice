"""Transport-neutral shared call runtime (Phase A, spec §6 / D-01/D-02).

``create_call_session`` is the ONE seam every live voice session — WebRTC
today, telephony from Phase 10 on — constructs, runs, and idempotently closes
through. It owns: ``gate_result`` -> :class:`~klanker_voice.session.SessionLifecycle`
-> :func:`~klanker_voice.pipeline.build_pipeline` (already transport-neutral,
accepting an arbitrary :class:`~pipecat.transports.base_transport.BaseTransport`)
-> observers -> warning/goodbye callbacks -> greeting -> a single idempotent
close path (:meth:`CallSession.close`).

Three couplings resisted a perfectly-clean extraction (D-08 architecture
note — see 09-01-SUMMARY.md for the full writeup):

1. The quota ``start_gate`` stays at the HTTP layer (``server.py``'s
   ``offer()``), ahead of any transport/pipeline construction (T-09-01) — its
   ``GateResult`` is threaded into this function as a parameter rather than
   invoked from inside the runtime.
2. The ambience mixer + the transport's ``TransportParams`` are built by the
   transport-specific caller, since they must be attached at transport
   construction time (D-03) — before this function ever sees the transport.
3. The pipeline is now built at connection-callback time (a local,
   network-free construction) rather than inside the old fire-and-forget
   tracked-session task. The genuinely slow step — ``lifecycle.start()``'s
   CloudWatch/ECS/DynamoDB calls — stays deferred inside :meth:`CallSession.run`,
   so the BUG-1 teardown-before-slow-start guarantee still holds.

This module imports ONLY transport-neutral pipecat base types plus
``klanker_voice`` modules — never a transport-specific signaling/connection
class, and never constructs a speech provider directly
(:mod:`klanker_voice.factories`, via ``build_pipeline``, remains the single
source, spec §22.2).
